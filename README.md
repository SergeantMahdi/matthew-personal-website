# This Repo Is Under Construction

This project is being build for my portfolio. It's a 3D full-stack website that uses different technologies like Three.js. the purpose of not using any frameworks like React and Next.js is to show my understanding and skills of using vanilla programming and scripting language.

Express, MongoDB, Joi and many other technologies are being used in this project that I'll explain them in depth in the document.
